# Convex Hull: Gift Wrapping Algorithm and Visualization

This project demonstrates the Gift Wrapping algorithm (Jarvis March) for computing the convex hull of a set of 2D points. It includes:
1. **Algorithm Implementation**: Computes the convex hull for a given set of points.
2. **Interactive Visualization**: A GUI to dynamically add and remove points, updating the convex hull in real-time.

## Features

### Gift Wrapping Algorithm
- Computes the convex hull as the smallest convex boundary enclosing all points.
- Efficient for small datasets.

### Visualization
- **Add Points**: Left-click on the canvas.
- **Remove Points**: Right-click on a point.
- Convex hull updates dynamically and is displayed as a polygon.

## Usage

1. **Run the Algorithm Implementation**:
   ```bash
   python GiftWrapping.py
Run the Visualization:
python Gift_wrapping_animation.py
Add and remove points interactively on the canvas.
The convex hull is automatically computed and displayed.
Requirements

Python 3.x
tkinter module (pre-installed with Python)
